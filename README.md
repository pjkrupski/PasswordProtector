# PasswordProtector
Provides a safe solution for storing login and password data within a local file system and hidden from possible infiltrators 



The inspiration for this project is the unfortunate event of a malicious user
successfully gaining full access to someones personal computer. This utility
provides the means for the users passwords to be kept secure within there
file system and hidden from the hacker who would be in search of bank logins,
social meadi accounts, and anything else they could infiltrate.
